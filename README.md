Details of what features have been completed so far & General state of the app 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All features of Sprint 1 have been completed including auto calculating GPA, expected GPA, adding courses & assignments,
editing courses & assignments, Letter or S/U grading system, specifying course credits, S/U grading system doesn't affect overall GPA, deleting courses & assignments. 

General state of the app is that the app is able to add, edit, delete course and assignments and store them to local database. The app calculates overall GPA and expected GPA. Those GPAs change whenever new courses or assignments are added. Those GPAs do not calculate grade from courses with S/U grading system.

I implemented My Course, My Assessment, Add Assessment, and Add Course activities. I put the course, weight, and assessment information into local database and load them when app starts. I also implemented Overall GPA and Overall Expected GPA. Courses with S/U grading system do not affect Overall GPA and Overall Expected GPA. Those courses will only show S or U instead of a letter grade. Multiple weights on a single course will show those weight names on Add Assessment activity.
